This repo contains examples discussed on [Rust Rabbit](https://rustrabbit.substack.com/).

## Run the Examples

Rust's Cargo utility provides a convenient mechanism for [running example code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-run.html#target-selection). To run the _basic ownership_ example from the root of this repo, use:

`cargo run --example basic-ownership`
